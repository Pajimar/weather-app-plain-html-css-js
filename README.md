# weather-app-plain-html-css-js
Beginner web app using html, css and javascript
The front end javascript injects weather data from the weather server AccuWeather (I am using the Locations API and CurrentConditions API)
This data is displayed in a custom made card with html and css. For the style I am using flexbox 
LocalStorage is used to display info from the last city searched
