## weather-app-plain-html-css-js
Beginner web app using html, css and javascript<br>
The front end javascript injects weather data from the weather server AccuWeather (I am using the Locations API and CurrentConditions API) <br>
This data is displayed in a custom made card with html and css. For the style I am using flexbox<br> 
LocalStorage is used to display info from the last city searched
